# Deep-Learning-A-Z
**Implementation of Various DeepLearning Techniaues in Python** 

This is series of various deep learning techniques in Python Programming Language. The code presented in this series is implemented from the 
[Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/learn/v4/overview) course. It is a very good course for learning Deep Learning. The Data se used are downloaded from [Super Data Science Website](https://www.superdatascience.com/deep-learning/). Happy Deep Learning.
